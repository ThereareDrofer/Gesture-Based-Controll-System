# Gesture-Based-Controll-System
In this repository you can find code for Gesture Recognition

The main.py file contains code for connecting the Wi-Fi camera by IP address, functions for fixing the coordinates of the smart home element and functions for sending the signal to the ESP 32 microcontroller.
For this file to work properly, it is necessary to download the audio tracks needed to play the signals when pointing and fixing coordinates.

The file ESP_32_PIR_WIFI.ino contains the file for flashing the ESP 32 through the Arduino IDE.
